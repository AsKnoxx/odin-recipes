            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Lightly sweet yet savory, Tamago also known as Tamagoyaki is a Japanese rolled omelette that makes a delightful<br>
                breakfast or side dish for your lunches. It's made by rolling together thin layers of fried eggs, then slicing<br>
                the log into rectangles.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 eggs</li>
                <li>1/4 cup prepared dashi stock</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon mirin (Japanese sweet wine)</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil, or more as needed</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all the ingredients.</li>
                <li>Beat eggs thoroughly in a bowl; whisk in dashi stock, sugar, mirin, and soy sauce until sugar has dissolved.<br>
                    Lightly grease a nonstick skillet and heat over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Pour a thin layer of egg mixture into the hot pan and swirl to coat the pan. Cook until egg layer is firm on<br>
                    the bottom but still slightly liquid on top, about 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Then lift up one edge using a spatula and roll up the egg layer.</li>
                <li>Push omelet roll to one side of the skillet. Oil the skillet again and pour in another thin layer of egg,<br>
                    lifting the first omelet roll up slightly to allow the egg to flow underneath.</li>
                <li>Roll up the first omelet in the new layer of egg and push omelet to the edge of the skillet as before.</li>
                <li>Repeat the process with the remaining egg mixture, oiling the pan each time if needed.</li>
                <li>Remove rolled omelet to a serving platter and cut into 6 equal pieces to serve.</li>
            </ol>
